# Battle of Dices is going to be an amazing 2 player game, 
# where two players face each other using only their sheer luck! 
# 
# The rules are:
# 
# Each player throws one D6.
# The player with the highest roll wins the round.  
# The first player to win 3 times is the winner.
#
# Our main task today is to implement the code necessary to bring this
# amazing game alive!
